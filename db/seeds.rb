# Examples:

#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# lab1 = Lab.create!(name: "Los Alamos National Laboratory")

# scientist1 = lab1.scientists.create!(name: "Robert Oppenheimer", specialty: "Physics", university: "University of Chicago")

# experiment1 = Experiment.create!(name: "Manhattan Project", objective: "Develop the first nuclear weapons", num_months: 36)
